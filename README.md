## Getting Started

This application is React.js, TailwindCSS, and Webpack bundler

```npm run start``` - Runs webpack-dev-server
```npx tailwindcss -i ./src/input.css -o ./src/output.css --watch```

.env does not get checked in, of course, so one will need to be created or vault in .dotencr

Open [http://localhost:3002](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
